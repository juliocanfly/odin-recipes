                <p><b>2.</b> CRUMBLE 40 GR OF YEAST AND DISSOLVE WITH YOUR HANDS.</p>
                <p><b>3.</b> ADD 1 KG OF PLAIN FLOUR, 20 GR OF SALT (WITHOUT LETTING IT TOUCH THE LIQUID SO AS NOT TO RUIN THE YEAST).</p>

                <p><b>5.</b> WHEN A DOUGH FORMS, TRANSFER TO A FLOURED COUNTER AND KNEAD FOR ABOUT 10 MINUTES UNTIL YOU HAVE A SMOOTH, SOFT DOUGH. COVER AND LET IT REST FOR ABOUT AN HOUR, UNTIL IT DOUBLES IN SIZE.</p>
                <p><b>6.</b> MEANWHILE, MAKE THE SAUCE: PUT 1 KG OF WHOLE CHERRY TOMATOES IN A BAKING DISH WITH 4 CRUSHED GARLIC CLOVES, OLIVE OIL, SALT AND PEPPER TO TASTE.</p>
                <p><b>7.</b> BAKE IN A HOT OVEN FOR APPROXIMATELY 30/40 MINUTES, UNTIL THEY ARE WELL COOKED AND BURSTING.</p>
                <p><b>8.</b> ONCE READY, MASH WITH A POTATO MASHER AND SET ASIDE.</p>
                <p><b>9.</b> RETURN TO THE RISEN DOUGH BALL, DEGAS AND MAKE TWO BALLS (YOU CAN SEPARATE THEM INTO 3 OR 4 BALLS AS WELL).</p>
